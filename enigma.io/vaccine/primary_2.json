The authors discussed about a case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) as a rare complication post influenza vaccination. This report refers to an 83-year-old female patient. Past medical history included hypertension, ischemic stroke and diabetes. Concomitant medications were not reported. She was vaccinated with influenza vaccine (manufacturer and batch number: not reported) on an unknown date. Five days after vaccination, she presented to a hospital with a two day history of altered mental status, weakness and fever. She was admitted to the hospital. On examination, she was obtunded, febrile with bilateral extensor plantar response and brisk reflexes. On an unknown date computed tomogram of the head was performed and it was unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed protein of 136 gm/dL, glucose of 108 gm/dL, with lymphocytic pleocytosis (44 cells/microliter). She was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for presumed infectious meningoencephalitis. Her mental status declined further and she required mechanical ventilation. On an unknown date, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine showed diffuse white matter lesions involving periventricular white matter, thalamus, midbrain, dorsal brainstem, cerebellum and medulla oblongata. CSF bacterial and fungal cultures, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, human herpes virus 6, enterovirus, JC and BK viruses; anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibody and flow cytometry for lymphoma were all negative. Serum studies for viral encephalitis, human immune virus and quantiferon-TB were also negative. She was given a diagnosis of post-vaccination ADEM based on the neurologic picture and MRI findings of extensive white matter changes along with recent influenza vaccination. She was treated with steroids, however she did not respond and she required plasmapheresis.

On 11 September 2013 the subject received a dose of influenza (details unknown). On 12 September 2013, 1 day after vaccination with influenza, the subject experienced pink around injection site and injection site hives and less than a week after vaccination with influenza, the subject experienced headache. The subject reported that she received her flu shot on Wednesday [11 September 2013] and for the \"first time event had a reaction\". She informed that she asked her mother to check if it was okay yesterday [12 September 2013] and her mother said it was 'a bit pink' (pink around injection site). She reported that she looked at it last night [12 September 2013] and \"had a silver dollar size hive with a smaller one above it\" (injection site hives). She noted, \"Obviously, it didn't bother me, but sure startled me when I did look. Might explain my headache too!\" At the time of reporting the outcome of the events was unspecified.

On 24 December 2013, the subject experienced lumbar compression fracture, back fracture (broke my back) and fell. This case was upgraded to medically serious by GSK. The subject stated that on 24 December 2013, she was trying to help her mother up, which caused the subject to fall and fracture her back. On 30 December 2013, the subject went to the doctor to have x-rays performed. The x-rays revealed a compression fracture of at least L1 (lumbar compression fracture).

I visited my physician and he determined an impingement in my rotator cuff, which could be from the needle hitting the bursa (from being too high).  I have been icing regularly, and applying Voltaren gel 4 times/day for a week (so far).  If the pain continues for a couple more weeks, a cortisone shot is the next course of action.","died":null,"datedied":null,"l_threat":null,"er_visit":"Y","hospital":null,"hospdays":null,"x_stay":null,"disable":null,"recovd":"N","vax_date":"2013-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","onset_date":"2013-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","numdays":"0","lab_data":null,"v_adminby":"OTH","v_fundby":"OTH","other_meds":"Lexapro, Zovia 25, Flonase","cur_ill":"No.","history":"Only asthma and seasonal/environmental allergies.","prior_vax":null,"splttype":null,"serialid":742},{"vaers_id":"519128","recvdate":"2014-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","state":"AZ","age_yrs":"71.0","cage_yr":"71","cage_mo":null,"sex":"M","rpt_date":"01/13/2014","symptom_text":"At the injection site, there is pain, warmth, swelling, redness, itching.","died":null,"datedied":null,"l_threat":null,"er_visit":null,"hospital":null,"hospdays":null,"x_stay":null,"disable":null,"recovd":null,"vax_date":"2014-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","onset_date":"2014-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","numdays":"1","lab_data":null,"v_adminby":"OTH","v_fundby":"PVT","other_meds":null,"cur_ill":"None","history":"Shrimp/lobster allergies","prior_vax":null,"splttype":null,"serialid":743},{"vaers_id":"519129","recvdate":"2014-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","state":"MD","age_yrs":"0.2","cage_yr":"0","cage_mo":"0.2","sex":"M","rpt_date":"01/13/2014","symptom_text":"Patient had one episode of hematemesis.","died":null,"datedied":null,"l_threat":null,"er_visit":"Y","hospital":null,"hospdays":null,"x_stay":null,"disable":null,"recovd":"Y","vax_date":"2014-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","onset_date":"2014-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","numdays":"3","lab_data":"None","v_adminby":"PVT","v_fundby":"PUB","other_meds":"Nysatin","cur_ill":"Thrush","history":"Thrush","prior_vax":null,"splttype":null,"serialid":744},{"vaers_id":"519130","recvdate":"2014-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","state":"FL","age_yrs":"2.0","cage_yr":"2","cage_mo":"0.5","sex":"F","rpt_date":"01/13/2014","symptom_text":"Raised rash/red, itchy on (L) arm around administration site.","died":null,"datedied":null,"l_threat":null,"er_visit":"Y","hospital":null,"hospdays":null,"x_stay":null,"disable":null,"recovd":"Y","vax_date":"2014-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","onset_date":"2014-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","numdays":"2","lab_data":null,"v_adminby":"PVT","v_fundby":"PUB","other_meds":"None","cur_ill":"None","history":"Prader-Willi syndrome; albinism","prior_vax":null,"splttype":null,"serialid":745},{"vaers_id":"519131","recvdate":"2014-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","state":"NY","age_yrs":"65.0","cage_yr":"65","cage_mo":null,"sex":"F","rpt_date":"01/13/2014","symptom_text":"Loose stools, diarrhea.","died":null,"datedied":null,"l_threat":null,"er_visit":null,"hospital":null,"hospdays":null,"x_stay":null,"disable":null,"recovd":"Y","vax_date":"2013-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","onset_date":"2013-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","numdays":"1","lab_data":"Colonoscopy showed microscopic lymphocytic colitis","v_adminby":"OTH","v_fundby":"PVT","other_meds":"Synthroid, Diovan, Simvastatin, Amitriptyline, Tamoxifen, Celebrex, Doxycycline","cur_ill":"No","history":"No","prior_vax":null,"splttype":null,"serialid":746},{"vaers_id":"519132","recvdate":"2014-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","state":"NJ","age_yrs":"50.0","cage_yr":"50","cage_mo":null,"sex":"M","rpt_date":"01/13/2014","symptom_text":"Headache, sinus congestion, thick nasal secretions lasting two weeks.

On 15 November 2013 the patient started Fluticasone propionate+salmeterol xinafoate (inhaled) 500/50, prescribed to be taken 1 puff, twice daily for lung congestion secondary to serum sickness. The patient reported that he suffered from serum sickness after a pneumonia and flu shot. He was prescribed ADVAIR diskus and he started taking the ADVAIR 500/50 on 15 November 2013. He was concerned about taking a steroid medication so he reduced his dose to ADVAIR 250/50 on 24 November 2013 and would take the medication on an as needed basis. He would take the product one puff at night before bedtime when he would feel a buildup in his chest of phlegm and he would start to cough. The ADVAIR product allowed him to sleep and he was pleased with the medication. In \"late\" December 2013, the patient experienced diabetes and borderline diabetes.

His wife stated he had been in good health exercising (run/lift weights) 6 days/week; and their 3 young children (ages 3 yo twins and 5 were healthy (no colds). According to his wife and review of medical records this 33 year old patient received his annual FLUMIST vaccination on 9/9/2013 (Lot # BH2026). Approximately 24 hours late he awoke with a non-productive cough and subjective fever. His wife said she could tell he didn't feel well. By 9/13/2013 (day 4) he complained of a headache with persistence of cough, subjective fever, and  profuse sweats. While he was able to go to work, he began to ease up on exercising. These symptoms waxed and waned without change until 9/27/2013 (day 18) when he became more lethargic, confused, with a weaving-upsetting gait holding wall with worsening headache, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck (no pain) and numbness to bilateral fingertips. His temperature was 101F. His wife described his confusion as repetitive phone calls asking same questions; he would get up and begin to write being able to write he name then his handwriting was illegible. He would stop and lay down only to repeat this action on getting up and was writing over same marks trying to correct without success. He was taken to nearby ER on 9/28/2013 (day 19) where he was evaluated for possible meningitis. Exam: alert, not oriented, confused, rales left base with diminished breath sounds bilaterally, poor respiratory effort (20 bpm 97% 21/nc) skin erythematous with macular papular spots on lower extremities (chigger bites per wife). CT head showed edema and WBC showed leukocytosis with left shift. He was transferred and admitted to hospital where his MRI showed extensive changes consistent with inflammatory/infectious process (possible acute postviral encephalitis or PRES). CXR showed evidence of atelectasis. LP was performed following 1 dose of antibiotics (on vancomycin and ceftriaxone) On 9/29/2013 he appeared ill, was drowsy but would awaken to voice, oriented to name only, could not read room sign but did follow objects at distance; left leg>arm>face weakness; problems with two step commands, problems communicating...diagnosed multifocal leukoencephalitis.

On 10/1/2013 he became obtunded, was unresponsive with posturing to upper extremities to pain and lower extremities withdrawing to pain. He was transferred to ICE and intubated and changed to a tracheostomy on 10/16/2013 for CPAP, secretion and airway maintenance. His trach was removed 11/8/2013. A ventriculostomy for decompressive purposes was required 10/1/2013 with ICP measurements peaking at 90 mmHG - his pressure was normal 10/15/2013 and the drain was removed. He received 5 plasmapheresis treatments with last treatment given 10/16/2013, and given broad spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and IV steroids. (There was no documentation on use of IVIG). During his hospitalization he was treated for and diagnosed with: ADEM, healthcare associated pneumonia, respiratory failure, dysphagia, encephalitis with increased intracranial pressure, hypoglycemia and bradycardia.

I woke up in the night and put my arms up to yawn and I noticed the left arm (where I got the shot) did not come up, just the right. I thought I might be dreaming, so later I tried it again and lo and behold, it did not come up. I had to take my right arm and pull my left one up. It hurt to do that, also. I have been taking pain pills (xtra strength TYLENOL and 800 MG ibuprofen). I also put Absorbine Jr liniment to try to help the pain. I keep praying and waiting for this to go away, but it is still there. I called on Monday after I first got the shot and another pharmacist suggested he might have nicked a nerve. He advised me to keep moving it and it would soon go away. I don't even know how to describe the pain I have with it now. It almost makes me cry to try to get my hair pulled up in the morning. From my shoulder to my elbow is the most painful. I can't lift my arm with pain. I would like some suggestions on how to get this problem solved.

Her optometrist diagnosed contact lens associated keratitis and prescribed loteprednol etabonate, ZYLET. On subsequent examination bilateral anterior uveitis grade as 2+ cell and 1 + flare was noted. Tropicamide 1% TID and PRED FORTE Q1 hour along with dexamethasone, TOBRADEX at bedtime were then prescribed. Reduction of inflammation was noted in one week, however the inflammation recurred as topical corticosteroid therapy was tapered. She was referred for systemic evaluation after six weeks because the inflammation remained active. Physical examination and serologic evaluations were performed by her primary care physician and a rheumatologist; however no underlying cause for her uveitis was discovered. Her maternal grandparents had rheumatoid arthritis. Four months after onset of her symptoms she was referred for uveitis consultation due to persistent inflammation despite PRED FORTE OU BID. History obtained at the time disclosed her initial GARDASIL was administered 2 weeks prior to onset of uveitis and her second vaccination was temporally associated with a flare of uveitis when her topical corticosteroid dose was reduced to twice daily. The patient and her family elected to defer the third vaccination in the series. Best corrected visual acuity at the time was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left. The conjunctiva was not injected. The cornea was normal in appearance without evidence of scarring or keratic precipitates. The anterior chamber reaction was graded as 3+ cell in both eyes. Trace vitreous cells were present in both eyes on slit lamp bio microscopy, and fluorescein angiography demonstrated late hyperfluorescence of the optic discs. Additional serologic work-up did not disclose any significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits with gadolinium contrast was unremarkable. Lumbar puncture was performed with a normal opening pressure. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was unremarkable. She was treated with CELEBREX 200mg twice daily and topical steroid therapy was eliminated. A trace amount of cells were observed intermittently in the anterior chamber over the course of the next three years without symptoms or sequelae of uveitis Glaucoma consultation was obtained and co-morbid pigment dispersion syndrome was excluded. CELEBREX was discontinued after 32 months of therapy and uveitis symptoms have not recurred after an additional 20 months. Best corrected visual acuity remained 20/20 in both eyes more than 4 years after onset of her symptoms. A total of 24 cases of uveitis occurred following administration of GARDASIL; the gender in all cases was female. The median age was 17.
