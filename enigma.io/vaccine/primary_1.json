His right arm did fine. By evening, his left bicep was swollen and red around the injection site. By the next morning, it was even larger and he had fluid building under his armpit. It continued to worsen throughout the day and by the evening the red portion covered all of his bicep and below and the swelling underneath the arm felt like a fluid filled balloon and almost made his armpit indistinguishable. I finally called our family physician on his cell that evening (he is a friend) and told him what was going on.  I was already icing it regularly and giving him ibuprofen.  He said that was really all I could do. I asked him if I should let the Health Department know the next day and he said that I could, but that they probably wouldn't do anything about it. My concern was for the next time he has to have this vaccine (in 10 years) - I wanted the reaction documented because I won't be with him when he receives it as an adult.  On 1/2/14, I took him to the HD and let someone look at it - the injection site also looked sunken by then (similar to old small-pox types spots).  She said this is \"normal\" and \"occurs 50% of the time\" with Tdap and that it is often bad in teens and adults.  I knew this wasn't entirely true, because his 2 older brothers didn't have this reaction.  Also, the hand-out did not have underarm swelling as an adverse effect or any reaction being 50% likely. She dismissed it as no big deal, but did say that his reaction was maybe a little worse than most.  I will never allow 2 injections to be given in the same extremity again.  Also, if this is common, someone should tell the parent to expect this reaction and definitely start icing and ibuprofen ahead of time.  Either he had an atypical reaction and someone should have documented it - neither Dr. or other person at the Health Department made any notes of his reaction - or the paperwork needs to be redone to make a parent aware that this is normal and they should go ahead and start icing and ibuprofen as soon as they get home.  I do have pictures of what his arm looked like on 1/1/13.  Today (1/4/13) the swelling has gone down a lot, but it isn't entirely gone. After looking at the next page, just to be clear: Left arm: Tdap & Meningoccal Right arm:  HPV (I have no way of knowing the manufacturers since they didn't even take my concern seriously.  I just picked a manufacturer on the one and picked something so it would let me submit.

An 83-year-old female was admitted with 2 days of altered mental status, weakness and fever. She had past medical history of hypertension, ischemic stroke and diabetes. She received inactivated influenza vaccine five days ago. On exam, she was obtunded, febrile with bilateral extensor plantar response and brisk reflexes. Computed tomogram of the head was unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed protein of 136 gm/dL, glucose of 108 gm/dL with lymphocytic pleocytosis (44 cells/microliter). Broad spectrum antibiotics were started for presumed infectious meningoencephalitis. Her mental status declined further and she required mechanical ventilation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine showed diffuse white matter lesions involving periventricular white matter, thalamus, midbrain, dorsal brainstem, cerebellum and medulla oblongata. CSF bacterial and fungal cultures, PCR for HSV, VZV, HHV-6, enterovirus, JC and BK viruses; anti-NMDA receptor antibody and flow cytometry for lymphoma were all negative. Serum studies for viral encephalitis, HIV and Quantiferon-TB were also negative. After exclusion of infectious and non-infectious causes, we made the diagnosis of post-vaccination ADEM based on the neurologic picture and MRI findings of extensive white matter changes along with recent influenza vaccination. DISCUSSION: ADEM is a rare inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with an incidence of 0.4/100.000. Infection is the most common etiology; post-vaccination ADEM for 5% of cases. However, ADEM that occurs after vaccination may not necessarily be attributable to the vaccine and might rather be a temporal association. In our patient, based on World Health Organization causality assessment criteria, post vaccination ADEM was very likely. Daily methylprednisolone for 3 - 5 days followed by prednisone taper is the accepted first line therapy. Plasmapheresis is recommended for steroid unresponsive patients. With early treatment initiation, full recovery is seen in 50% to 75% of patients, within 1 - 6 months. Our patient did not respond to steroids and required plasmapheresis. She showed neurologic recovery with improved MRI and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on day 42. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should consider post - vaccination acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in patients with encephalopathy, multifocal neurological findings and recent vaccination after carefully excluding other causes.","died":null,"datedied":null,"l_threat":null,"er_visit":null,"hospital":"Y","hospdays":null,"x_stay":null,"disable":null,"recovd":"U","vax_date":null,"onset_date":null,"numdays":null,"lab_data":"CSF bacterial and fungal cultures, PCR for HSV, VZV, HHV-6, enterovirus, JC and BK viruses; anti-NMDA receptor antibody and flow cytometry for lymphoma were all negative.

On an unknown date the patient was vaccinated with PNEUMOVAX23 dose 2 in the right arm (dose, route and indication not reported). Other suspect therapies included meningococcal conjugate vaccine (unspecified) dose 2 in the left arm on the same date. In her previous clinic review, she reported leg pain that sometimes required pain medication and headache pain in the past 4 weeks. She also had chronic splenomegaly from her sickle cell disease. At this visit she received the PNEUMOVAX23 in her right arm and meningococcal conjugate vaccine in her left arm. The patient's immunization history included one dose of PNEUMOVAX23 two and a half years earlier, and a dose of the meningococcal conjugate 6 months prior to the event. She also had received four doses of th 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, one dose of the 13-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, the hepatitis B, and annual influenza vaccinations. Her mother had previously reported that she usually developed a low grade fever after receiving vaccinations, which she would treat at home with ibuprofen. The patient's past medical history included recurrent otitis media, requiring placement of tympanostomy tubes, and asthma, She also had a history of urticarial response to fire and bites, and skin-test confirmed allergies to dust, mold, mildew and cockroaches. In this report the patient experienced an unusual severe local reaction to PNEUMOVAX23. The patient presented with arm swelling, redness and pain as well as fever and nausea after immunization during a routine follow-up visit the day before. The patient developed pain in her head, neck and arm and a fever of 102.9 degrees F in the early morning the day after receiving the vaccine. Her mother administered ibuprofen. 10 h later, the mother reported a fever of 101.3 degrees F and right arm swelling with edema to the extent that it was difficult to put a shirt sleeve over the arm. The patient was brought to the Hematology clinic where she received ketorolac for pain and ondansetron for nausea reported at the clinic. Upon examination, it was noted that the right arm was tender with redness over the lateral aspect and swelling down to the elbow. She received one dose of IV ceftriaxone, but blood culture was subsequently negative. She was discharged from the clinic with ibuprofen and morphine for break-through pain. The swelling in the right arm resolved at home within 24 h. Discussion: This patient was a young girl with sickle cell disease who presented with fever and limb swelling after a second vaccination with both PPSV23 and the meningococcal conjugate vaccine. Of note, she had received multiple doses of pneumococcal vaccines, and the PPSV23 vaccination associated with this event was administered only 2.5 years after the previous PPSV23-earlier than the 3 years recommended by guidelines. Additionally, she was 5 years old at the time of the limb swelling, much younger than those in previous reports of limb swelling after PPSV23 vaccination. The limb swelling described above can be classified as a local reaction due to vaccination as defined by The Brighton Collaboration Local Reaction Working Group for Swelling at or Near Injection Site. With a score of three from the Naranjo Algorithm for determining adverse events, the case report described above could be considered an adverse drug event. Since the swelling occurred in the same arm as the PNEUMOVAX23 injection and since it was the second PNEUMOVAX23 vaccination, it was likely that PNEUMOVAX23 caused the adverse event. It is possible that administering PNEUMOVAX23 earlier than the recommended 3 years of repeated exposures to polysaccharide capsule antigens might have been contributing factors. Additionally, the immune reaction might have been amplified by the conjugated meningococcal vaccine administered concurrently i","died":null,"datedied":null,"l_threat":null,"er_visit":"Y","hospital":null,"hospdays":null,"x_stay":null,"disable":null,"recovd":"Y","vax_date":null,"onset_date":null,"numdays":null,"lab_data":"Blood culture, Negative, negative; Body temperature, 102.9 F; Body temperature, 101.3 F","v_adminby":"OTH","v_fundby":"OTH","other_meds":"No other medications","cur_ill":"Splenomegaly; Headache; Pain in extremity; Sickle cell anaemia; Prophylaxis; House dust allergy; Hypersensitivity; Mycotic allergy","history":"Asthma; Ear tube insertion; Otitis media; Pyrexia; Urticaria; Ibuprofen, Pyrexia; Pneumococcal 13v conj vaccine, one dose, prophylaxis; Pneumococcal conj vaccine, four dose, prophylaxis; Meningococcal conj vaccine, one dose, prophylaxis; Influenza, annual, prophylaxis; Hepatitis B virus vaccine, series, prophylaxis","prior_vax":null,"splttype":"WAES1312USA009279","serialid":496},{"vaers_id":"518754","recvdate":"2014-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","state":null,"age_yrs":null,"cage_yr":null,"cage_mo":null,"sex":"U","rpt_date":"01/08/2014","symptom_text":"This spontaneous report as received from a pharmacist refers to a patient of unknown age and gender.
