After the study, the patient learned she had been given the placebo and then later after her son was born, in approximately 2007, she received the actual GARDASIL (dose, route and lot number were not reported). No co-suspect therapies were reported. There was no concomitant medication. The patient stated that during the study she passed out after one of the GARDASIL doses but she does not know if it was a placebo dose or one of the doses related to the GARDASIL product dose. The patient also stated she often did not feel well after receiving the GARDASIL doses (again she did not know if they were the placebo or the actual product dose). The patient had questions about the efficacy of GARDASIL because she was recently, about six months ago (approximately in August 2013) diagnosed with HPV type 16 even though she was vaccinated against it. At the time of this report the outcome was unknown. No treatment was given for the adverse events. Papanicolaou (PAP) smear and colonoscopy was performed. The patient sought medical attention.

When I woke up the second time to get ready for work, my face was bright red my chest was flushed, my pulse was racing and my upper lip and mouth Was swollen. My face became more puffy as the day went on. I called my drs office because my heart was racing & I was having anxiety because I couldn't get it to come down. That night I started to feel a bit better so I took benadryl and went to bed. I again woke up early in the morning with very fast pulse. First day I was 110 BPM resting and on Friday I was 127 BPM.

Waking up Saturday and Sunday I had an ache in my chest and the beginning of pressure like a 3 on the pain scale.  Monday I called my doctor & he believed I was having an anxiety attack and called me in  medicine. The Ativan seemed to calm me down but my pulse stayed high. The next day the pressure had increased in my chest and my heart was at over 130 BPM resting. the pain was radiating out from my center chest to below my collarbone and into my right arm I went to my moms & she took my blood pressure and it was 172/140. The pain stayed constant & I was getting a terrible headache on top of the pain. She immediately took me to the ER for treatment. My blood pressure finally started to stabilize after they gave nitroglycerine & it took away my chest pain. My pulse regularly stayed over 100bpm until 01/09/2014.

A 15-month-old female patient of unspecified ethnicity received single doses of PREVNAR, diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis, haemophilus influenzae b and measles, mumps and rubella, all administered via unspecified routes of administration, on unspecified dates. The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, the mother of the patient reported that her daughter was severely injured by a reaction to the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis at 15 months of age (when measles, mumps and rubella, haemophilus influenza b and pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate were also given). The mother reported that the patient had a vaccine reaction and just spiraled out of control; onset dates unspecified. On unspecified dates, the patient's fever spiked to 105.7 and she began screaming. The patient also experienced seizure disorder; she stared blankly and developed seizures on an unspecified date. Then she experienced shaking episodes at night and repetitive behaviors, including arm flapping and spinning; onset dates unspecified. She developed a measles-type rash on an unspecified date. Things went from bad to worse; the patient experienced damage and suffering. A neurologist noted on unspecified dates, that the patient had staring spells and an abnormal EEG. Another diagnosed the patient with encephalopathy characterized by speech delay and probable global developmental delay that occurred in the setting of temporal association with immunization as an acute encephalopathy. The patient's mother filed for an encephalopathy table injury in 2003 unaware that the patient would be diagnosed with PDD-NOS, a form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on an unspecified date. Relevant lab data on an unspecified date included an EEG and an MRI, which indicated that everything was consistent with encephalopathy, post-vaccination. The clinical outcomes of fever spiked to 105.7, screaming, seizure disorder, staring spells/stared blankly, shaking episodes at night, repetitive behaviors, including arm flapping and spinning, measles-type rash, abnormal EEG, encephalopathy, speech delay, probable global developmental delay and PDD-NOS, a form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were unknown.
